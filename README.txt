Install Ruby- 2.2.1 and rails 4.2.4 (But by default 4.2.5 is being installed) 
    -> Ruby

          (When downloading ruby select 4.2.1 from archives)
          -> Install DevKit to install rubyGem. Separate installation of rubyGem has an error hence rails are not installed properly

      Rails will be installed automatically.
